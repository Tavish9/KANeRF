# Hands-On NeRF with KAN
【KAN: Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19756) is a promising challenger to traditional MLPs. We're thrilled about integrating KAN into [NeRF](https://www.matthewtancik.com/nerf)! Is KAN suited for **view synthesis** tasks? What challenges will we face? How will we tackle them? We provide initial observations and future research directions!
